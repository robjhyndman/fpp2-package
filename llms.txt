# fpp2

## Overview

The R package *fpp2* loads data required for the examples and exercises
used in the book [*Forecasting: Principles and Practice* (2nd
edition)](https://otexts.com/fpp2/) by Rob J Hyndman and George
Athanasopoulos. It also loads several packages needed to do the analysis
described in the book.

## Installation
